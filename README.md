# Excel Data Analysis Project: Sales Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project showcases my proficiency in Excel-based data analysis. The objective was to analyze a company's sales data to uncover insights across various dimensions such as products, salespersons, regions, and years. The analysis culminated in the creation of an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore sales performance and make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Includes steps to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formatting.
- **Analysis Methods**: Outlines the Excel tools and techniques utilized, including Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Statistical Analysis, and Data Visualization.
- **Dashboard**: The final interactive dashboard that presents key sales insights through various visualizations and filters.

## Files

- **Sales_Data.xlsx**: The raw sales dataset used for analysis.
- **Sales_Dashboard.xlsx**: The final Excel dashboard with interactive features, including filters for products, regions, salespersons, and years.
- **README.md**: This readme file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Analysis Process

### Context of the Analysis
The dataset provided revolves around the company's sales data, and the goal was to address key business-related questions, such as:
- Sales performance by product
- Sales performance by salesperson
- Sales distribution by year and region
- Year-over-year growth trends

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Duplicates Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing data using imputation techniques and removed incomplete records as necessary.
- **Data Formatting**: Standardized dates, currency, and numerical values for consistency.

### Analysis Techniques
- **Pivot Tables**: Used to dynamically summarize sales data by product, salesperson, region, and year.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to highlight top-performing products and regions with the highest sales.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilized Excelâ€™s functions like AVERAGE, SUM, and MEDIAN to derive insights into sales performance variability.
- **Data Visualization**: Created charts (bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts) for visual representation of the findings.

### Key Insights
- **Top Products**: Bottles and Tonic were consistently top performers, contributing the most to overall revenue.
- **Regional Performance**: Asia and Africa had the highest sales, while Europe showed growth potential.
- **Salesperson Performance**: Homer Simpson consistently outperformed others, making a significant impact on the company's overall success.
- **Year-over-Year Trends**: Steady growth was observed, with a notable spike in Year 2013, possibly due to seasonal demand or a successful product launch.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard is interactive and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to:
- Filter data by product, region, salesperson, or year.
- View detailed performance metrics across different dimensions.
- Make data-driven decisions based on the insights provided.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Open the Dashboard**: Load the `Sales_Dashboard.xlsx` file in Excel.
2. **Explore the Data**: Use the interactive filters (slicers) to drill down into specific products, regions, salespersons, or years.
3. **Analyze Insights**: Leverage the visualizations and statistics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sales performance.
4. **Make Informed Decisions**: Use the findings to make strategic business decisions or recommendations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my capability to manage complex datasets, conduct detailed analysis, and present insights in a clear and actionable format. The interactive dashboard facilitates informed decision-making and offers a powerful tool for business strategy. I believe these skills are aligned with roles requiring data-driven insights, such as Research Coordinator or Data Analyst positions.
